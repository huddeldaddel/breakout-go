## Installation and Getting Started

### Project Structure

Breakout-GO is beeing developed in C++ using Microsoft Visual Studio 2019 and the Arduino IDE. The project therefor has a project structure that allows you to use both IDEs in parallel:

The full source code for the game is located in [/Breakout-Go](https://github.com/huddeldaddel/breakout-go/tree/master/Breakout-Go) - which is the project folder for the Arduino IDE. A Visual Studio 2019 Solution file is located at [/Breakout.sln](https://github.com/huddeldaddel/breakout-go/blob/master/Breakout.sln). Opening that file in Visual Studio will open a Solution with two projects: [/Breakout-Win](https://github.com/huddeldaddel/breakout-go/tree/master/Breakout-Win) is just an empty project - you can ignore it. [/Breakout-Win-Test](https://github.com/huddeldaddel/breakout-go/tree/master/Breakout-Win-Test) is the Unit Test project used to write, test and debug most of the code. It imports most of the C++ source files from /Breakout-Go.

This setup has several advantages over the exclusive use of the Arduino IDE:

*   The source code can be checked automatically via unit tests.
*   The unit tests can also be executed in the debugger. Critical parts of the code can thus be very easily examined at different input values.
*   Visual Studio is just the better editor for experienced developers.

### Compiling and Deploying to the ODROID-GO

*   Follow the [steps decribed in the ODROID Wiki](https://wiki.odroid.com/odroid_go/arduino/01_arduino_setup) to set up the development environment 
*   Get a copy of the source code by running `git clone https://github.com/huddeldaddel/breakout-go.git`
*   Connect your ODROID-GO via USB
*   Start your Arduino IDE and open [/Breakout-Go/Breakout-Go.ino](https://github.com/huddeldaddel/breakout-go/blob/master/Breakout-Go/Breakout-Go.ino)
*   Click "Upload" to compile the source code and upload the game
